Placement Module Introduction
The International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) is a premier institution known for its academic excellence, research contributions, and innovation in the field of information technology. As one of the top-ranked institutions in India, IIIT-H attracts talented students and faculty members, creating a dynamic and competitive environment.

To manage its diverse academic and administrative functions, IIIT-H utilizes the Institute Management System (IMS), a comprehensive digital platform that streamlines operations across the institution. The Placements Module within the IMS is a critical component, designed to facilitate and manage the end-to-end placement process for students.

This module plays a vital role in bridging the gap between students and recruiters, making the recruitment process efficient and transparent. It handles multiple workflows, including company registrations, student registrations, and the recruitment process itself, ensuring that all stakeholders are effectively engaged and that the placement cycle runs smoothly.

This document outlines the requirements for three key processes in the Placements Module: Company Registration, Student Registration, and Recruitment Process. Each of these processes is essential to the functioning of the module and contributes directly to ensuring that students and companies can seamlessly interact during the placement season.
In this assignment, I have documented the requirements engineering processes for the Placement Module at IIIT-H, with a focus on the quality standards expected from the IMS (Institute Management System) platform. The goal is to ensure that the IMS supports key processes such as Company Registration, Student Registration, and the Recruitment Process effectively, while adhering to the highest standards of performance, security, and usability.

Throughout this assignment, I have ensured that the elicited requirements, and the IMS meet the following quality aspects:

Clarity:
The IMS must provide a clear and intuitive interface for students, companies, and placement coordinators (SPCs). Each process, from registration to recruitment, should be easy to follow, ensuring users can perform actions such as uploading documents, applying for jobs, or reviewing student profiles without confusion.

Completeness:
The IMS must support the entire lifecycle of the placement process, from initial student and company registration to the final recruitment outcomes. All necessary fields, documents, and steps should be accounted for to ensure no part of the process is left incomplete.

Consistency:
The system must maintain consistency in its operations and interactions. Whether it's company profile creation, job notifications, or student registrations, the IMS must ensure that workflows are consistent, allowing for smooth transitions between steps without unnecessary deviations or complexities.

Security:
Given the sensitive nature of student and company data, the IMS must ensure the highest level of security. All information uploaded, including resumes, offer letters, and job profiles, should be encrypted both during transmission and storage. Access to data should be restricted to authorized personnel, ensuring compliance with data protection standards.

Performance:
The IMS must be optimized for high performance, especially during peak placement periods when multiple registrations, job postings, and recruitment activities are occurring simultaneously. Tasks such as document uploads, job searches, and profile reviews should be handled efficiently, with minimal load times, ensuring that users experience no delays in completing their actions.

Scalability:
The IMS must be scalable to handle a large number of concurrent users, especially during critical periods like the start of placements. It should be able to process multiple student registrations, company profiles, and job postings simultaneously without any degradation in performance.

Error Handling:
The IMS must include robust error handling mechanisms to guide users when issues arise, such as missing documents or incomplete registrations. Notifications and prompts should be clear and actionable, allowing users to resolve errors quickly without disrupting the process.

By ensuring these quality standards are met, the IMS platform will deliver a reliable, secure, and efficient experience for all stakeholders involved in the placement process, including students, companies, and placement officers.
