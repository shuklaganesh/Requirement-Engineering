| **Overview**              | The Company Registration process ensures that companies create an account on IMS, complete their company profile, and provide job profile details along with eligibility and recruitment process requirements. The Company POC (Point of Contact) is responsible for coordinating with the placement head and resolving any technical issues. |
| **Type**                  | Primary                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Actors**                | - **Company POC (Point of Contact)** (primary initiator)<br>- **Placement Head** (facilitator, reviewer)                                                                 |
| **Preconditions**         | - The company must have received an invitation to register on the IMS portal.<br>- The company POC must have valid login credentials to access the IMS platform.           |
| **Main Flow**             | **1. Create Account on IMS:**<br> The company creates an account on IMS, using the Company POC’s email as the unique ID.<br> **2.

| **Alternate Flow**        | **Technical Issues:**<br> If there are technical issues while completing the registration or filling job profiles, the Company POC coordinates with the Placement Head for resolution.<br> **JAF Not Finalized:**<br> If the company does not finalize the JAF during the registration, they may update it later through IMS before the recruitment process begins. |
