| **Overview**              | The Recruitment Process use case describes how Student Placement Coordinators (SPCs) act as Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for companies during the recruitment process. SPCs are responsible for releasing job notifications, coordinating with companies, and managing the recruitment activities between students and companies. The process follows a structured workflow between SPCs, companies, and students as outlined in the attached image. |
| **Type**                  | Primary                                                                                                                                                                  |
