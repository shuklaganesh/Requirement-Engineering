# Importance of Requirements Quality Control in Placement Module (IMS)

## Why Validation and Verification?

Validation and Verification (V&V) are crucial to ensure the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of the Placement Module. By implementing V&V, we ensure:
- **Validation**: That the Placement Module meets the requirements and provides a user-friendly, error-free experience for students, companies, and SPCs.
- **Verification**: That the Placement Module works as designed and adheres to all specified requirements.

## Benefits of V&V:
- Detects bugs early in the development cycle.
- Ensures that all processes (Student Registration, Company Registration, Recruitment Process) function without errors.
- Guarantees that the system handles edge cases, incomplete registrations, and technical issues.
